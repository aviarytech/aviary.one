## aviary.id
Aviary ID is the cryptographic key secure storage and interaction toolkit. For on-chain, public data it uses the [Metalink ID](https://bsvabi.org/#/?id=_1-metalink-id) system which allows decentralized, psuedononymous digital identity. removing third parties and enabling immutable, cryptographically verifiable, enforcably unique, uniquely addressable and infinitely scalable identity. It also leverages W3C compliant [Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) to enable [Trust Over IP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQMlWxplp8Y).


## aviary.live
Aviary Live is the read feed. The endless lists of information. The worldstream. A user's Aviary Live database will consist of relevant public information from a trusted source such as a blockchain or a trusted connection.

* Public data is most commonly sourced from a public blockchain such as the Bitcoin SV blockchain, the Sovrin Network or issued directly from a trusted party.
* Private data is received encrypted directly by and from another user. This **friend-to-friend** communication happens over [DIDComm messaging](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-messaging) with messages encrypted and signed using the [JSON Web Message (JWM)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-looker-jwm/) specification.

Information can be differentiated (prioritized, deprioritized and described) using the [21e8](https://master-plan.21e8.com/) pricing protocol. This provides market-centric digital identities facilitate identification of collaborative projects, similar to being able to resolve the word 'bitcoin'. A given digital asset can be attested using a collection of proofs of work and a registry of magic numbers such that adjacent nodes form a high-dimensional reputation score for indivisible items.

## aviary.pub
Aviary Pub is where users create and write information and data. Public data they create can be sent to a miner to be included in a public blockchain for anyone in the world to read or directly to another user leveraging [Simple Payment Verification (SPV)](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Simplified_Payment_Verification). Users will be charged small microtransaction fees for public, on-chain data. Private output is transmitted over DIDComm messaging to other users or backup/hub servers.
